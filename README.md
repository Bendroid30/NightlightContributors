# Translations
This is the place where you can contribute by helping translate Nightlight to different languages.
### How do I do that?
1. Fork the repository and make changes to the JSON file corresponding to the language you choose to translate
2. Submit a pull request with the changes
3. Tada!
### What if I want to add a new language?
The steps are very similar, but instead of modifying an existing JSON, simply copy the en.json and rename it to the language you want to add, translate that file to your language and then submit a pull request!
### Some translations are missing in my language
If there are translations missing for some text on Nightlight, you can create a new value in the JSON you're modifying/making. Make sure to include what text it's for in the PR.

## FAQ
Will I get credited for my translations?
 - Yes! Your name will appear next to the language setting description, you can look into other JSON files that were contributed for reference!
   
Can I use a translation tool like Google Translate / DeepL or AI?
 - No. Any translations you submit have to be translate by you alone.
